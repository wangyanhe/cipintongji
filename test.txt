my english is very very poor.i want to go to school and study.Firstly, children can get a good education when they are sent to kindergartens.Now,kindergarten teachers all have received a good education and have rich experience. Secondly, children can exercise themselves and their independent ability when they go to kindergarten. In this big environment, children can not rely on their parents for everything.Last but not least, children can learn how to get along with their classmates better when they go to kindergarten.
